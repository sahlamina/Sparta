# abstraction

``` python
when using methods in our code

def bark(self):
    return "woof"

print (fido.bark())
outcome - woof

```

## inheritance
``` bash
Animal - from animal clas inherited:
attributed and functionalities

snake inherited everything from the animal class from import Anumal

def __init__(self)
        super.init() # this refers to parent/ base class
snake(Animal)
print(animal.sleep())
```

## polymorphism

````bash
we can inherit as wll as override particular attributes

````

## encapsulation

````
making variable even methods private to hide various aspects of the class from a user

````
